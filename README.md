# Contracts for Nordle (Wordle on the blockchain) 
This was inspired by [Loot (for Adventurers)](https://opensea.io/collection/lootproject) and the hit game [Nordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). It was a project to mess around with the idea of editing/adding onto on-chain metadata of NFTs. It has many of the same mechanics of Nordle, but with blockchain interactions.

The motivation with the front-end was to experiment with redux and typescript within React. Through this project, I have learned that redux is only worth adding to a project only if it is complicated enough to warrant a state management library. A small game did not warrant that. 

This portion of the project is left largely unpolished/unfinished as fixing the sizing of the SVG's was taking way too long.
